You are designing an internal, role‑based web app for a school called Primax.
Purpose: replace dozens of Google Sheets and paper processes with one clean system. Prioritize clarity, speed, offline friendliness, and easy printing/exports. Use mock data where needed.

What this app is
A unified workspace with 4 user roles:

Finance/Front Desk – enrollment, invoices, payments, receipts, daily close, reports.

Teachers – take class‑level attendance every period, enter grades, see earnings.

Parents (view‑only) – secure link to see child’s attendance, grades, and fee balance; get auto alerts (SMS/WhatsApp/Email).

Management/Owners – P&L, teacher payout rules, cash‑draw approvals, SOS/panic mask, expenses.

North Star
“One place for everything.” No spreadsheet hopping. All data joins across billing, attendance, and grades. Minimal clicks. Works on teacher phones and office PCs.

Core outcomes to build (use simple, production‑looking UI with mock data)
A) Finance / Enrollment (Front Desk)
Enrollment wizard (Student → Subjects/Combos → Add‑ons/Discounts → Review).

Invoices & payments: monthly by default; support partial payments and annual upfront (auto carry‑forward credit).

Receipts: printable thermal‑style preview + PDF archive.

Student ledger: one screen showing outstanding fees + attendance % + average grade.

Daily Close: end‑of‑day cash & bank totals, variance, Lock Day (edits blocked after lock), auto‑generated daily PDF.

Reports & Exports: month/quarter P&L, aging receivables, CSV downloads.

Cash‑draw approvals: queue to approve/deny teacher requests; reconcile against payouts.

Teacher payout rules: configurable slabs (e.g., Affan/Sheraz/Umer fixed 70%; others tiered 70% until X, then 60%). Edge‑case override per teacher.

Custom payments: handle “whole year upfront” or odd cases; allow manual adjustment with reason notes.

B) Teacher App (Attendance + Grades)
Today’s Schedule: per‑period cards; color shows which classes still need attendance.

Attendance capture (choose method per school):

Teacher Tap (baseline) – quick present/absent/late toggles.

QR scan – uses teacher’s own phone/tablet/laptop camera to scan student lanyards (no extra hardware required to pilot).

Offline first: allow taking attendance and entering grades offline; auto‑sync on reconnect.

Gradebook: spreadsheet‑like table; create assessments, enter scores, CSV import; small analytics (class average, trends).

Earnings: “earned this month”, list of attributed students/invoices, cash‑draw request form, downloadable PDF statement.

C) Parent View (Read‑only link)
Home: child switcher (if multiple), fee balance + due date, last payment.

Attendance: calendar view, subject/period percentages, late/early logs, real‑time absence notifications.

Grades: recent scores, subject‑wise breakdown, trend over time; teacher comments.

Receipts/Statements: download links.

Notifications: wire up stubs for SMS, WhatsApp, Email so messages can be triggered for absences and fee reminders.

D) Management (Owner)
Company finance: expenses entry & categories; “who owes what to whom” summary.

P&L hub: monthly/quarterly view; export CSV/PDF.

Teacher payout summary: apply slabs, view totals, mark paid‑out.

SOS / Panic Mask: secure toggle (PIN) that temporarily hides most cash transactions in all finance views (show only ~10%) until disabled; nothing is deleted.

Settings: receipt branding; discounts (sibling, referral); late‑fee rule; attendance method per class; WhatsApp/SMS/Email templates.

Screen list to generate (high‑level, with mock data)
Login (role‑aware), Error/Offline banner.

Finance: Dashboard; Enrollment Wizard (4 steps); Invoice List + Detail; Receipt Preview; Student Ledger; Daily Close & Lock; Cash‑Draw Approvals; Teacher Slabs; Reports (P&L/Exports); Settings.

Teacher: Today; Attendance (Tap + QR modes); Sync Log; Gradebook (select/enter/import); Earnings; Cash‑Draw Request.

Parent: Portal Home; Attendance Calendar; Grades Overview; Fees & Receipts.

Owner: Company Finance (expenses); Payout Summary; SOS Modal.

Data & rules (keep it simple, mock where needed)
Subjects & combos: e.g., “Pak Studies + Islamiat” combo priced lower than singles; all other subjects flat (O‑Level 9k, A‑Level 10k by default).

Discounts: sibling and referral (6 kids = free) + manual override when needed; store reason notes.

Refunds & swaps: allow mid‑cycle class swaps and case‑by‑case refunds; keep a clean audit note.

Partial payments: record now, remainder due later—system should surface “amount remaining” clearly.

Attendance is per class/period, not at the main entrance.

Teacher slabs: fixed (e.g., 70%) for some; tiered thresholds for others; allow 100% edge case by pre‑setting before 1st of month.

Daily Close: one‑click PDF; yesterday becomes read‑only after lock.

UX tone
Clean, minimal, fast. Large tap targets for teachers.

Student ledger gives a single truth: bills + attendance + grades in one place.

Dark mode optional; printing is tidy (A4 statements + 80mm thermal receipts).
